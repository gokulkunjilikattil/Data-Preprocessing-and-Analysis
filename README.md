Analysis and Visualizations

Task 1: Distribution of Employees Across Each Team

Overview:
We looked at how many employees are in each team and calculated what percentage of the total employees each team represents.
Insights:
Some teams have a lot more employees than others. This could mean those teams have bigger projects or need more people to get their work done.
The bar plot and pie chart help us see which teams are bigger and how the employees are spread out across the teams.

Task 2: Segregate Employees Based on Their Positions

Overview:
We counted how many employees are in each position within the company.
Insights:
The bar plot shows us which positions have more employees. This can tell us which roles are most important or most common in the company.
Knowing the distribution of positions can help the company plan for training, hiring, and promotions.

Task 3: Identify the Predominant Age Group Among Employees

Overview:
We divided the employees into age groups and counted how many people are in each group.
Insights:
The bar plot shows us which age groups have the most employees. This can help the company understand the demographics of their workforce.
Knowing the predominant age group can help the company tailor their policies and benefits to fit their employees better.

Task 4: Discover Which Team and Position Have the Highest Salary Expenditure

Overview:
We calculated the total salary cost for each team and each position to find out which ones cost the most.
Insights:
The bar plots show us which teams and positions have the highest salary expenditures. This is useful for budgeting and financial planning.
Knowing where the most money is spent on salaries can help the company make better decisions about resource allocation.

Task 5: Correlation Between Age and Salary

Overview:
We looked at the relationship between age and salary to see if older employees tend to earn more.
We used a scatter plot to visualize this relationship.
Insights:
The correlation coefficient tells us how strong the relationship is between age and salary. In this case, it was a certain value (e.g., 0.5).
The scatter plot helps us see if there is a trend where older employees generally earn more or if there isn't a clear pattern.
Understanding this relationship can help the company make fair salary decisions and address any pay disparities.


Key Trends and Patterns

Team Distribution: Some teams are much larger than others, which might mean they have bigger workloads or projects.
Position Distribution: Certain positions have more employees, indicating they might be crucial roles within the company.
Age Demographics: Knowing the most common age group can help tailor company policies and benefits.
Salary Expenditure: Identifying where the most money is spent on salaries helps with budgeting and financial planning.
Age-Salary Correlation: Understanding how age affects salary helps ensure fair compensation practices.


Conclusion
This analysis gave us a good look at how employees are distributed across teams and positions, the age demographics of the company, and how salary expenditures are spread out. The visualizations helped us see the key trends and patterns, which can help the company make better decisions for HR policies, budgeting, and workforce management.
